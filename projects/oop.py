# Procedural Programming
# set of commands or sequence of instructions or procedures that call each other for execution of the program
# follows a top-down approach
# cannot manage a large scale project

# Object Oriented Programming
# based on the concept of objects rather than functions or logic
# to model a real world entity into an object, define object's attributes (what it has) amd methods (what it does)

# from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# timmy = Turtle()
# timmy.shape("turtle") # methods (what it does)
# timmy.color("coral")
# print("Turtle's previous position: ",timmy.position())
# timmy.forward(70)
# print("Turtle's current position: ", timmy.position())
# my_screen = Screen()
# print(my_screen.canvheight) # attributes (what it has)

# my_screen.exitonclick()



# Python Packages
# from prettytable import PrettyTable

# table = PrettyTable()
# table.add_column("Pokemon Name", ["Pikachu", "Squirtle", "Charmander"])
# table.add_column("Type", ["Electric", "Water", "Fire"])
# table.align = "l"
# print(table)
